Once you see the output indicating that the crawl has started and completed successfully, you can consider the following steps:

1. Analyze the Output
Review the Titles and Links: Check the titles and any links printed by the crawler to ensure it's extracting the correct information.
Debugging: If there are any errors or unexpected output, review your code to address those issues.
2. Expand the Crawler
Increase Functionality: Enhance your crawler by adding features like:
Storing Results: Save the crawled data (URLs, titles, etc.) to a file or database.
Depth Limiting: Implement depth control to limit how deep the crawler goes.
Filtering Links: Add filtering to only crawl certain types of pages or avoid duplicates.
3. Test with Different URLs
Try Other Websites: Use different seed URLs to test the crawlerâ€™s adaptability.
Check Against Robots.txt: Make sure your crawler respects the robots.txt files of different sites.
4. Implement Error Handling
Robustness: Add better error handling to gracefully manage issues like network timeouts or invalid URLs.
5. Explore Web Scraping Libraries
Learn Libraries: Familiarize yourself with more advanced libraries such as:
Scrapy: A powerful web scraping framework.
Selenium: For scraping dynamic content (like JavaScript-rendered pages).
6. Consider Ethical Guidelines
Respect Website Policies: Always respect the terms of service and ethical guidelines of websites you crawl.
Be Considerate: Avoid overwhelming the server with requests; implement delays between requests.
7. Build on the Crawler
Create a Search Index: If you want to build a search engine, you could start indexing the data collected by your crawler.
Search Functionality: Implement a basic search interface to query the indexed data.
8. Explore Data Analysis
Analyze Data: If you gather a lot of data, consider using data analysis tools or techniques to extract insights from the crawled data.
Summary
After confirming your crawler works, focus on enhancing its functionality, testing with various sites, and ensuring it operates ethically. If you're interested in broader applications, consider building out features for data storage, search capabilities, or even transitioning to a more robust web scraping framework. If you have specific goals or features in mind, let me know, and I can provide more targeted advice!
