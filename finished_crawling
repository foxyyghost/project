Yes, that output indicates that the crawler is working correctly for the basic functionality. Here’s a breakdown of what you see:

Starting the Crawl: This confirms that the crawling process has begun.

Current URL: The crawler is attempting to fetch the seed URL (https://duckduckgo.com).

Visiting: The crawler successfully fetched the page and extracted the title, which is "DuckDuckGo — Privacy, simplified." This shows that the parsing and title extraction is functioning as expected.

Crawl Finished: The process ended, likely because it reached the maximum number of pages to crawl (which is set to 100) or there were no additional links to follow.

What to Check Next:
Links Extraction: If you want to see more URLs being visited, ensure that the parse_page function is correctly extracting and adding links to self.to_visit. If there are no additional links on the DuckDuckGo homepage (or if they are filtered out), the crawl will end quickly.

Database Entries: You can check your SQLite database (crawled_data.db) to see if the page was stored correctly. You should have an entry for the DuckDuckGo homepage.

Allowed Domains: Ensure that other domains you might want to crawl are added to the allowed_domains list if you expand the crawl.

If you're looking to see more activity (more URLs being crawled), consider using a different seed URL with more links or modifying the crawler logic to follow more links. Let me know if you need further assistance!
